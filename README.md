Identifying Malnutrition in Children Using Photos


📌 Overview
This project utilizes deep learning and computer vision to detect signs of malnutrition in children through image analysis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained using TensorFlow/Keras to classify the nutritional status based on facial and body features.

The model runs locally and can be tested by executing the script with an image input.

🚀 Features
Deep Learning-Based malnutrition classification
Locally deployable model (No need for a web app or server)
TensorFlow/Keras CNN architecture for image analysis
Simple and efficient implementation

How It Works
Load the trained deep learning model from model.py
Provide an image of a child as input
The model processes the image and classifies the nutritional status
The classification result is printed in the console

🏗 Technologies Used
Python (Deep Learning & Image Processing)
TensorFlow/Keras (Model Training & Prediction)
OpenCV & Pillow (Image Processing)
NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)

🎯 Future Scope
Improve accuracy with more diverse datasets
Extend to a GUI-based interface using Tkinter or Streamlit
Optimize model for mobile or edge devices
